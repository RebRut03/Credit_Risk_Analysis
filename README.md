# Credit Risk Analysis

## Credit Risk Overview:
In this portion of the project, I'll use different techniques to train and evaluate models. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, I'll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, Iâ€™ll combine over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I'll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, in an attempt to predict credit risk. Once completed, I'll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models

## Credit Risk Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
